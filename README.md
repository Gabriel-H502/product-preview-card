## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Pure HTML & CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time building a responsive project. It was a little hard, but I managed to solve my problems. I learned to use Media Queries using `<picture>` on HTML and `@media` on CSS, but still looking forward to get better on these topics.
